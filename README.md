In this project we are looking at temperature differences between months of June and Dec in Hawaii between 1/1/2010 to 23/08/2017
Using the data sets and our queries, we are trying to 
-	1. The temperature variations in the month of June. 
-	2. The temperature variations in the month of December.
## Results
-	The minimum temperature in the month of June is 64 and the maximum temperature is 85 with median 75, mean of 75 and standard deviation of 3.2 indicating that the distribution is narrow around the average
-	The minimum temperature in the month of December is 56 and the maximum temperature is 83 with median 74, mean of 71 and standard deviation of 3.7 indicating that the distribution is narrow around the average
## Summary 
1.	The average temperature in June is only slightly higher than December.
2.	I looked at number of days in June and December for the temperature ranges around 60 to 65 and 70 to 80 . I found that for the month of June, there are 4 days in June where the temperature has been between 60 to 65 while for 1567 days the temperature has been between 70 to 80. This range changes for December: there are 119 days with temperature between 60 to 65 and 1032 days with temperature between 70 to 80.
